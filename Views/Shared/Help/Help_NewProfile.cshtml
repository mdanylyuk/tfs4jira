<p>New synchronization profile creation is a two-step process. On this view you can provide some basic profile properties, such as: name, synchronization interval, error handling mode and JIRA and TFS servers location and credentials. After hitting a "Create Profile" button you will be redirected to a view, where you will be able to configure field mappings.</p>
<p>The profile will be created as disabled, so it won't run automatically. After you've finished configuring the profile, you can enable it on the @Html.ActionLink("Configuration view", "Index", "Tfs", new { id = string.Empty }, null).</p>
